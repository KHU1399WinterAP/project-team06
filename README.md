This game is based on competition. There are some questions that need to be answered in limited time. You can select the question's category. There are various categories that you can choose based on you preference.

You can use power-ups to assist you answering questions! The thing is you need coins to use them :) . Inorder to collect coins you just have to answer the questions correctly.

There is a scoreboard that you can find the top 20 players there. Can you compete with them? :) .

We hope you enjoy playing our game.

This game is developed by Khurazmi university students. We used JForm Designer in the designing process! It's one of the [**intellij**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) plugins so we recommend you to install both Intellij and its plugin before playing the game.
